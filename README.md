This dashboard is not about coffee. 
It’s about how data supports daily business decisions.

If I were managing a coffee shop, I wouldn’t ask “How many charts do we have?” I’d ask:

• When should I add more staff?

• Which products should I prioritize in inventory?

• Which store actually drives the business?

That’s the mindset behind this Coffee Shop Business Performance Dashboard (2023). From the data, I focused on:

☕ Staffing decisions — transactions peak between 7–10 AM, highlighting strong morning demand
📦 Inventory planning — coffee dominates revenue contribution, while regular size is the most preferred option
🏬 Store performance — Hell’s Kitchen consistently generates the highest revenue among all locations

This project is part of my journey transitioning into a Data Analyst / Business Analyst role, where I focus on turning data into clear, actionable insights — not just visuals.
